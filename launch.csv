have Helen say 'Yaaaaaaaaaay',
get help from Doogie Spencer,
visit Facebark,
visit Meowspace,
photograph a Launcher sleepy,
put a bang on it,
let Nathan know that it is his turn for a photo,
go on a vacation,
create individualized emojis,
pug bomb 5,
join the team at Rubizzle,
bundle install all the gems,
use Rails magic,
grab some bubble tea,
check my pokedex with christina,
have Patrick do my taxes,
have Alex wave frantically when the conversation goes off topic,
have Chris W. on my side in the event of nuclear war,
see :Omid2:,
enjoy Friday Fun Time with the heathens,
have Eric sneak up like a cat,
sing with Sinatra,
take a quick trip to Space Boston,
railsify something,
build cool shit,
go on a Dangent,
put in a help request,
