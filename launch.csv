figure out who is six degrees from Marky Mark,
get dumplings with Judy,
attend awards hosted by DJ Lil' Steve,
have my app hacked by Lil' Stevie Tables,
experience a Boston error,
get together with foo at the bar,
determine whether or not it is Friday,
tap dance with Lauren,
handle fire with Christina,
save the world with Cori,
get Lakitu to animate Inception Doge,
have Helen say 'Yaaaaaaaaaay',
get help from Doogie Spencer,
visit Facebark,
visit Meowspace,
photograph a Launcher sleepy,
let Nathan know that it is his turn for a photo,
go on a vacation,
create individualized emojis,
join the team at Rubizzle,
use Rails magic,
grab some bubble tea,
have Patrick do my taxes,
have Alex wave frantically when the conversation goes off topic,
have Chris W. on my side in the event of nuclear war,
see :Omid2:,
enjoy Friday Fun Time with the heathens,
have Eric sneak up like a cat,
sing with Sinatra,
take a quick trip to Space Boston,
railsify something,
build cool shit,
go on a Dangent,
put in a help request,
attend Launcher lunch
