find love in a hopeless place,
stop believing,
paint it black,
let it be,
touch this,
check out the mic while my DJ revolves it,
hit me baby one more time,
put a ring on it,
reach for the sky so if you fall you land in a cloud,
spend the night together,
get you out of my head,
get down on Friday,
play that funky music white boy,
say he's just a friend,
tell me all your thoughts on God,
sing us a song you're the piano man,
tell by the way I use my walk,
doowutchyalike,
get up get on up,
get up off of that thing,
talk about Shaft,
sit and watch as time goes by,
want you to pour some sugar on me,
take on me,
bust a move,
push it,
feel the beat on the tambourine,
be your teenaged dream,
vogue,
go chasing waterfalls,
dance the night away,
go on now go,
walk out the door,
pump the jam,
call me big poppa,
let it go,
be the king of pain,
put out the red light,
turn back time,
sock it to me
