find love in a hopeless place,
stop believing,
paint it black,
let it be,
touch this,
check out the mic while my DJ revolves it,
hit me baby one more time,
put a ring on it,
reach for the sky so if you fall you land in a cloud,
spend the night together,
get you out of my head,
get down on Friday,
play that funky music white boy,
say he's just a friend,
tell me all your thoughts on God,
sing us a song you're the piano man,
tell by the way I use my walk,
doowutchyalike,
get up get on up,
get up off of that thing,
talk about Shaft,
sit and watch as time goes by,
want you to pour some sugar on me,
take on me,
bust a move,
push it,
feel the beat on the tambourine,
be your teenaged dream,
vogue,
go chasing waterfalls,
dance the night away,
go on now go,
walk out the door,
pump the jam,
call me Big Poppa,
be the king of pain,
put out the red light,
turn back time,
sock it to me,
bang bang all over you,
conceal don't feel don't let them know,
find out what happens to solid water when it gets warm,
let it go,
wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy,
swing from the chandelier,
bring sexy back,
drop it like itâ€™s hot,
get it started in here,
bow wow wow yippee yo yippee yay,
fly like paper get high like planes,
like big butts and I cannot lie,
shine bright like a diamond,
feel the rains down in Africa,
walk like an Egyptian,
pop drop and lock it,
turn my swag on,
thank you for being a friend,
stand under my umbrella,
clear my throat,
cry me a river,
live your life,
want to know what love is
