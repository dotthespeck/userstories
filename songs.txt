find love in a hopeless place,
stop believing,
paint it black,
let it be,
touch this,
check out the mic while my DJ revolves it,
hit me baby one more time,
put a ring on it,
reach for the sky so if you fall you land in a cloud,
spend the night together,
get you out of my head,
get down on Friday,
play that funky music white boy,
say he's just a friend,
tell me all your thoughts on God,
sing us a song you're the piano man,
tell by the way I use my walk,
